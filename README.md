# ShipCrewsRefAutoBlazorApp

## Aim
To demonstrate the use of Blazor Components and using a referenced REST service.

## Notes
First install and run https://github.com/SimonV839/ShipCrewsWebApiRestSwaggerEF-2.git which will run a REST service this app makes use of.

Add the open api service reference: https://localhost:7075/swagger/v1/swagger.json (see above).  
Note: make sure to refresh this (rather than re-adding), if the above gets updated.

Generally, the pages in this app demonstrate knowledge obtained from following learn.microsoft.com courses.  

### Examples:  
Referencing a open api (REST) service
Passing parameters to pages
Pages navigation
Various types of data validation
Referencing JavaScript
Template components
